# PsychlabU
Unity Application for running psychophysics experiments in virtual reality (or without virtual reality). Inspired by Psychlab (thats the reason for this name. U stands for Unity). 

Includes assets from "Standard Assets" and "Oculus Integrations" asset packs.

Application was developed for my bachelor's thesis. 

The licence is attached to the thesis.
